# Eye-Exercise 

This is a simple and fun project that demonstrates how to create an interactive animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this application, two eyes will follow the movement of your mouse cursor around the screen.

## Demo

You can see a live demo of the application here#https://jrosero21.github.io/Eye-Exercise/.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Web Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the application.

## How It Works

The Application utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the eye-following effect. Here's how it works:

- **HTML Structure**: The `index.html` file provides the basic structure of the webpage, including elements for the eyes and any additional content.

- **CSS Styling**: The `styles.css` file defines the styles for various elements, such as the eyes, background, and layout. It also includes elements to create the eye-following effect.

- **JavaScript Interactivity**: The `script.js` file contains the JavaScript code responsible for the interactive behavior of the eyes. It tracks the movement of the mouse cursor using event listeners and updates the position of the eyes accordingly, giving the illusion that they are following the cursor.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the Application to your liking! You can experiment with different colors, sizes, and styles to change the appearance of the eyes and background. Additionally, you can modify the JavaScript code to adjust the speed or behavior of the eye-following effect.
